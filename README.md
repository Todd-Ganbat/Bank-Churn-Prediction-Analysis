Bank Churn Prediction Analysis - README
Project Overview
This project, Bank Churn Prediction Analysis, was developed as part of the group assignment for the ETF5912 course. The primary objective was to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques implemented in R, focusing on classification trees and logistic regression. The findings aim to guide customer retention strategies with data-driven insights.

Objectives
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepare the dataset for modeling.
To build predictive models using:
Classification Trees
Logistic Regression
To evaluate model performance and recommend the best-performing approach.
To derive actionable insights into customer churn.
Key Components
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations and statistical summaries of features.
Detection of missing values and outliers.
Exploration of correlations to identify significant variables.
Data Preprocessing:

Imputation of missing data.
Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
Data splitting into training and test sets.
Model Development:

Classification Trees: Applied to capture complex, nonlinear relationships in the data.
Logistic Regression: Used as a benchmark for comparison.
Evaluation based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results & Insights:

Analysis of model performance and key influencing factors.
Recommendations for targeted customer retention efforts.
Methodology
Tools Used:
Programming Language: R
Libraries: tidyverse, caret, rpart, ggplot2, and others.
Dataset:
Includes customer demographic, account, and transactional data.
Statistical Techniques:
Feature correlation analysis.
Model evaluation using confusion matrices and AUC scores.
How to Run
Ensure R and required packages are installed. Use the install.packages() function for any missing libraries.
Download or clone the repository containing the .Rmd or .R scripts.
Open the R script in RStudio or an equivalent IDE.
Execute the script line-by-line to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
Conclusion
The analysis successfully identified key features influencing customer churn and demonstrated that the classification tree model outperformed logistic regression. These insights can inform effective customer retention strategies.
